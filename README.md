# health-tracker

---

## Overview

This app is being developed for a few reasons.
- One, to continue to increase my experience with building full-stack Django applications.
- Two, most applications I've built have been simpler with only one or two bits if CRUD functionality, so I am planning to build a somewhat larger scale project with multiple "apps".
- Third and perhaps just as important, I've been using various applications and spreadsheets (!) to track my own health goals, so I want to build something I can use to keep all of that together.

## Project Goals

### MVP

- [ ] Allow users to set initial health data, such as height and weight, in their profiles
- [ ] Implement a weight tracking application, which will display the entry date, the weight for that date, the net weight change from starting, and the net change in BMI
- [ ] Implement a generic task-based tracker for exercise goals where users will be able to add an activity, enter the unit of measurement (reps, time, etc.), and a goal
- [ ] App deployment

### Additional goals

- [ ] Research what other types of health data someone may want to track and implement accordingly
- [ ] Add third-party (social) account authentication
- [ ] Anything else?
